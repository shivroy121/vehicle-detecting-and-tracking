Vehicle detecting and tracking using OpenCV and Java and GeoTools.


Land vehicles motion simulation in anywhere on earth with real routes and GPS signals.
Scope of simulated data:

location: valid GPS latitude/longitude value with timestamp
vehicle motion: speed in metre per second
Details
It's a location provider that can be configured with RESTful endpoints:

add or generate large number (1000+) of vehicles
start simulation from specified place
subscribe to latest vehicle gps position
Details of the short description:

Keyword	Description
land vehicles	car, truck
motion simulation	randomly generated point-to-point route playback to infinity
real routes	real-time generated itinerary (used Openrouteservice Directions API)
